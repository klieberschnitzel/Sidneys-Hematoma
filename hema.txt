Sidney's Hematoma
It's enlarging but I'm hoping it will shrink as the pus underneath his tough kitty skin, oozes.
Before I left to AZ, his skin has some scatches that were oozing.
I left a cloth and bowl for tracy to do warm compresses on Sydney's hematoma
The bowl would hold the warm water for the compress

If I pop/lance the hematoma, there will be a lot of pus.
