Sidney's Hematoma
It's enlarging but I'm hoping it will shrink as the pus underneath his tough kitty skin, oozes.
Before I left to AZ, his skin has some scatches that were oozing.
I left a cloth and bowl for tracy to do warm compresses on Sydney's hematoma
The bowl would hold the warm water for the compress

If I pop/lance the hematoma, there will be a lot of pus.

How will I prevent the hematoma from popping and pus getting everywhere. Yeeuk
You have to pop the hematoma and it will possible get everywhere.  
Having a bunch of rags, maybe even an towel that Sid should be laying on, will 
prevent the pus from getting on places you don't want it on.  Limiting the clean up 
just to the towel.  You'll also what paper towels, hydrogen peroxide, not alcohol, because it'll
be less painful.  Warm water, a bowl
